        Dragon Ball (Japanese: ドラゴンボール, Hepburn: Doragon Bōru) is a
        Japanese media franchise created by Akira Toriyama in 1984. The initial
        manga, written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in Weekly
        Shōnen Jump from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters
        collected in 42 tankōbon volumes by its publisher Shueisha. Dragon Ball
        was originally inspired by the classical 16th-century Chinese novel
        Journey to the West, combined with elements of Hong Kong martial arts
        films. Dragon Ball characters also use a variety of East Asian martial
        arts styles, including karate[1][2][3] and Wing Chun (kung fu).[2][3][4]
        The series follows the adventures of protagonist Son Goku from his
        childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts. He spends his
        childhood far from civilization until he meets a teen girl named Bulma,
        who encourages him to join her quest in exploring the world in search of
        the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting
        dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several other
        friends, becomes a family man, discovers his alien heritage, and battles
        a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls.

        Toriyama's manga was adapted and divided into two anime series produced
        by Toei Animation: Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, which together were
        broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. Additionally, the studio has
        developed 21 animated feature films and three television specials, as
        well as an anime sequel series titled Dragon Ball GT (1996–1997) and an
        anime midquel series titled Dragon Ball Super (2015–2018). From 2009 to
        2015, a revised version of Dragon Ball Z aired in Japan under the title
        Dragon Ball Kai, as a recut that follows the manga's story more
        faithfully by removing most of the material featured exclusively in the
        anime. Several companies have developed various types of merchandise
        based on the series leading to a large media franchise that includes
        films (both animated and live-action), collectible trading card games,
        action figures, collections of soundtracks, and numerous video games.
        Dragon Ball has become one of the highest-grossing media franchises of
        all time.

        Since its release, Dragon Ball has become one of the most successful
        manga and anime series of all time, with the manga sold in over 40
        countries and the anime broadcast in more than 80 countries. The manga's
        42 collected tankōbon volumes have over 160 million copies sold in Japan
        and 260 million copies sold worldwide,[5][a][c] making it one of the
        best-selling manga series of all time. Reviewers have praised the art,
        characterization, and humor of the story. It is widely regarded as one
        of the greatest and most influential manga series ever made, with many
        manga artists citing Dragon Ball as a source of inspiration for their
        own now-popular works. The anime, particularly Dragon Ball Z, is also
        highly popular around the world and is considered one of the most
        influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western
        culture. It has had a considerable impact on global popular culture,
        referenced by and inspiring numerous artists, athletes, celebrities,
        filmmakers, musicians, and writers around the world.
